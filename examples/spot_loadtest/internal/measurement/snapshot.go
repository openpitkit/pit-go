// Snapshot is the complete post-run measurement picture exposed to the Phase-5
// reporter. It carries per-window trajectory data, merged percentiles for the
// headline streams, throughput, reject rate, harness overhead, inner metrics,
// and the anti-DCE checksum.
//
// Throughput is labeled "decided ops / wall time" and is a separate saturation
// measurement; the latency figures come from HdrHistogram windows with full CO
// correction and must never be taken from a saturation run.
type Snapshot struct {
	// Windows is the per-window trajectory (oldest first). Each window holds
	// order-check and settlement percentile distributions AND their raw
	// HdrHistogram copies (WindowSnapshot.OrderCheckHist / SettlementHist).
	Windows []WindowSnapshot

	// OrderCheck is the merged order-check (stage 1->2) percentiles across the
	// full run. This is the headline latency stream.
	OrderCheck Percentiles
	// Settlement is the merged settlement (stage 3->4) percentiles.
	Settlement Percentiles

	// SteadyStateOrderCheck is the order-check percentiles computed by a
	// lossless Merge of the raw HdrHistograms from the steady-state windows
	// (windows[WarmupWindows:]). When WarmupWindows == 0 this is identical to
	// OrderCheck (same histogram set). This MUST be used for the headline
	// number; percentile-of-percentiles over window Percentiles is invalid.
	SteadyStateOrderCheck Percentiles
	// SteadyStateSettlement is the settlement percentiles for the same
	// steady-state window range.
	SteadyStateSettlement Percentiles
	// WarmupWindows is the number of leading windows excluded from the
	// steady-state merge (0 when all windows are included).
	WarmupWindows int

	// ServiceTime is the order-check SERVICE-TIME diagnostic (resolve - actual
	// submit instant), merged over the whole run. It is explicitly NOT the
	// headline: the headline is the open-loop order-check latency (OrderCheck /
	// SteadyStateOrderCheck, measured resolve - VirtualT0). Service-time hides the
	// saturation tail by construction (it discounts queue wait that accrued before
	// the actual submit), so the reporter surfaces it only as a labelled
	// diagnostic, never as the headline.
	ServiceTime Percentiles

	// Throughput is the number of decided operations per second, computed from
	// the wall time between the first RecordSubmit and the last RecordResolve.
	// Labeled as a separate saturation metric, not the headline.
	Throughput float64

	// TotalOrderChecks / TotalSettlements are raw resolved-operation counts.
	TotalOrderChecks uint64
	TotalSettlements uint64
	// TotalAccepts is the number of ORDER-CHECK decisions that were accepted
	// (order-checks only; settlement and funding accepts are reported on their
	// own lines so a reader never sees accepts exceed order-checks).
	TotalAccepts uint64
	// TotalRejects is the number of order-check decisions that were rejected
	// (order-check rejects only; settlement/funding outcomes are not counted here).
	TotalRejects uint64

	// outcomes, kept separate from the order-check accept/reject tally.
	TotalSettlementAccepts uint64
	TotalSettlementBlocks  uint64
	// TotalFundings / TotalFundingAccepts / TotalFundingRejects are the runtime
	// funding (top-up) adjustments resolved on the async path. Funding is NOT an
	// order-check: it is excluded from the headline histogram and the
	// achieved-reject-rate denominator and is disclosed only as its own line.

	// AchievedRejectRate is order-check rejects / total order-check decisions
	// (accepts + rejects of order checks only). Settlements are NOT subject to
	// rejection by the reject controller and must not appear in the denominator;
	// including them would dilute the metric and make a run that hits the 5%
	// target exactly report ~2.56%. Guard: 0.0 when no order checks were recorded.
	AchievedRejectRate float64

	// MaxInFlight is the peak concurrent submitted-but-unresolved op count:
	// the open-loop witness (> 1 means submissions overlapped decisions).
	MaxInFlight int64

	// Backpressure is the number of submits the engine refused with a
	// dispatch-capacity backpressure signal (ErrQueueLimit). It is an explicit
	// measured outcome, never a silent drop; a healthy baseline reports zero.
	Backpressure uint64

	// HandoffStalls is the number of HARNESS-internal handoff stalls: the
	// collector -> finalizer fast path was full and the submit schedule would
	// otherwise have been throttled by the harness's own off-path backlog. It is a
	// HARNESS-side starvation witness, NOT engine latency: a collector blocked in
	// fut.Await because the engine is slow is REAL latency and stays in the
	// headline, never counted here. A non-zero count invalidates the run because
	// the headline could fold the harness backlog into the published engine
	// latency; a healthy run reports zero.
	HandoffStalls uint64

	// MaxWorkOverflow is the peak depth of the submitter -> collector spill
	// (workOverflow). DIAGNOSTIC only - NOT an INVALID signal, and NOT folded into
	// the anti-DCE checksum. A large value means collectors lagged submission:
	// usually because they were legitimately blocked in fut.Await (real engine
	// latency, correctly in the headline), but under host CPU starvation it can
	// include collector-dispatch delay that inflates - never flatters - the tail.
	// Cross-check throughput and engine-compute when this depth is large.
	MaxWorkOverflow int

	// ClampedSamples is the total number of latency samples (across the
	// order-check, settlement, service-time, observer, and overhead histograms)
	// whose value exceeded the histogram ceiling and was SATURATED to it rather
	// than dropped. A non-zero count means the upper tail saturated at the
	// ceiling; the count is reported so the saturation is never hidden.
	ClampedSamples int64

	// Checksum is the anti-DCE proof that every decision was consumed.
	Checksum uint64

	// Overhead is the harness self-overhead characterisation (empty-submit
	// round-trip with no workload). May be zero if not probed.
	Overhead OverheadSummary

	// engine_compute, queue lifecycle). Populated only when Observer = true.
